flacconvert ist a small script that will auto-convert flac files into:

- mp3 (320)
- mp3 (V0)
- mp3 (V2)
- ogg
- aac

more file formats can easily be added.



Current status:  it works



Current features:

- MULTI-THREADING: that makes transcoding much faster
- incremental conversion possible by comparing last modified timestamp (although if aborted during conversion of a file that file won't be auto-deleted)
- auto-creation of .torrent file



Usage:

Edit flacconvert.sh
In the upper part of the script the the variables accordingly.
The script will convert everything that is unchecked in the conv_arr array.
Note: There's very little error checking for filepaths. Make sure the basefolder or the absolute folder to the flacfolder exists. No flacfolder, no conversions.

Make executable
chmod 0755 flacconvert.sh

Run:
./flacconvert.sh



Prerequisites:

- lame
- flac
- mktorrent
- vorbis-tools
- faac



Todo:

- add (more) error handling
- add switches to only run flac conversion or only generate the .torrent files
- better this README
- add examples to the README
